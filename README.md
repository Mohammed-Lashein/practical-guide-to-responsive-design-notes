Here I write my notes on following along with [practical guide to responsive design by kevin powell](https://youtu.be/x4u1yp3Msao).

### What is the need for this css declaration for an `img` reset?

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}
```

The above line of code makes the image adapt to the screen instead of overflowing the screen (and thus showing unnecessary horizontal scrollbar).

I have made a small recording to visualize the effect of the above css declaration (Note: that in the video, I just used `max-width: 100%;` because it just worked)
